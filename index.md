<p>As it stands currently, the entire United States East Coast (USEC) remains unaccounted for in terms of knowing our risk for tsunami events. My job was to address this gap in tsunami research. I was funded by NOAA to map tsunami risk for the entire USEC in a project with the National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program, the University of Delaware, the University of Rhode Island, and NESEC. I determined that several counties in New York, New Jersey, Virginia, and Florida were the in the top 10 most at-risk counties. I also created an interactive web map which allows the user to weight the inputs to the risk metric depending on their personal preference. The webmap raises awareness of tsunami risk along the East Coast and provides an easy platform for all to download the data I created.</p><br>

<p>Data management is becoming increasingly important to people who utilize earth science data. As part of their initiative to increase understanding of data management best practices, DataONE created the Data Management Skillbuilding Hub. "The hub" is a public, online, community-driven resource for educational materials regarding data management. My task as the community outreach intern was to increase public contributions by creating a step-by-step submission tutorial in the form of several webpages on the Skillbuilding Hub website.</p><br>

<p> With sea levels on the rise, low-lying countries such as the Marshall Islands (RMI) are facing serious challenges to their everyday lives. Our task as the Pacific Oceans Team was to create a climatology (30 years of data) specifically for the RMI for three oceanic components: 1) wave heights, 2) sea level anomalies, and 3) tides. From the climatology, we were able to determine recent trends in oceanic behavior and calculate risk percentiles for coastal inundation depending on the three oceanic factors. We handed over our coastal-inundation risk assessment tool in the form of a wave-rose atlas for our partners at the University of Hawaii Sea Level Center to aid their own work in the Marshall Islans. Our team also had partners at NOAA, for whom we were able to perform a preliminary accuracy assessment for their (then) recently launched satellite sea-level anomaly product, OCEANWATCH.

<p>Hopkins, Belize is a small coastal village with hopes of growing into a hub for cultural tourism. Like many other Central American countries, the combination of tourism, climate change, and underdevelopment puts nations like Belize at risk for an unsustainable future. Our goal was to help Hopkins in their development by mapping village infrastructure and marine debris and making this data publicly available for their use. This meant that we had to create from scratch our own geodatabase in ArcGIS online, create our own research and sampling methodologies, use the Collector app for Arc to record presence and characteristics of marine debris on the coast, and finally, analyze the data we collected. A really unique and interesting part of this project was our foray into participatory mapping methods, where we surveyed Hopkins locals (with IRB approved surveys) and created maps which visualized public perception of marine debris versus actual presence of marine debris.
