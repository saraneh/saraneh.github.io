## Utilizing NASA/NOAA Joint OSTM and Modeled Wave Data to Assess Trends in Sea Surface Height in the U.S. Affiliated Pacific Islands
#### NASA DEVELOP at NOAA NCEI- Pacific Oceans Team: India Young, Katie Walker, Alec Courtright, Saraneh Fitzgerald
<figure><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1nip42v_p8xMI6bwWzXcep9Z9V5n2MSuj" width = "100%" ><figcaption>Performed a  comparison of two sea surface height (SSH) satellite products. AVISO and OceanWatch data was validated using higher resolution NASA PODAAC JPL (ssh) data, with OceanWatch resulting in a slightly higher mean average error (MAE)</figcaption></figure><br>
